              <p class="story">   When one considers places for a mid afternoon stroll, a concentration camp does not normally come to mind as a contender for an ideal setting. However, just an hour northwest of Prague sits Terezín, an 18th century Bohemian military fortress built by the Austrian emperor Joseph II. Terezín served as a military fortress until the 19th century, and then as an Austro-Hungarian political prison during World War I.</p>

              <p class="story">   It was just before World War II that Terezín, as well as much of Western Czechoslovakia was signed over to Nazi Germany as part of the Munich Agreement. In 1940, the fortress designed to protect the people of Bohemia began being used to imprison and transport its people to their deaths.</p>

              <p class="story">   Wandering about the streets of this concentration camp was not as outright saddening or morbid as one might predict. Terezín is striking and littered with bright colored buildings and flowers. If you had no prior knowledge of the town before seeing it, it would seem like the perfect place for an afternoon walk.</p>

              <p class="story">   Terezín was used as the first destination for more than 150,000 Jewish people. One in four people died after their arrival to the concentration camp, and almost 90,000 people were transported and ultimately executed at other Nazi concentration camps. The Gestapo prodded 30,000 people through the gates of the Small Fortress, where nearly 3,000 people died of disease or were executed at the hands of the Nazis.</p>

              <p class="story">   It was not until I reached the Small Fortress where I learned the extent of the unfathomable fate of so many that the blue skies turned blacker than midnight, the white clouds were full of thunder and the perfectly quiet afternoon stroll turned deafeningly silent. Looking back, the nearly empty streets seem flooded with the atrocities that took place, the silence of the town sounds like the cries of the millions imprisoned, and the flowers blooming represent the lives forever changed and lost in the walls of the camp. There is nothing beautiful left in Terezín.</p>
